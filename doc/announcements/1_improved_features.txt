Hi Dancers,

Ever wonder, what’s going on today in the PDX dance community? I’ve got the answer for you! Daily Dancer is a magic calendar that I created that answers that very question, and helps you connect with events as they are happening. Click here to check it out: pdxdailydancer.com

This website pulls all the events from the Sacred Circle listserv and puts it onto one, current calendar. Plus, I’ve designed it to now pull events from pdxecstaticdance.com as well. Daily Dancer has been a lot of fun to concept and build, and is my gift to our beautiful dance tribe.

Maybe you’ve thought, “what’s the address to that thing I saw on this very mailing list?” Ask the Daily Dancer.  Or “is there a Naked Bliss dance this Thursday? Daily Dancer knows. (They only happen every 1st and 3rd)

The Daily Dancer’s web address is easy to remember: pdxdailydancer.com  (our city, plus the name of the calendar). Bookmark the page—it’ll come in handy when you really want the information.

If you have any questions, please send an email to jackdesert@gmail.com.

Best,
Jack Desert
