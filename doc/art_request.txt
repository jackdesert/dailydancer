Hi Vincent,

You designed https://freecinc.com/ for me, and it turned out great!

This time I would like you to design a site that has the functionality of
http://dailydancer.jackdesert.com/
that looks great on an iPhone.

What the site does is takes the contents of an email list-serve, and generates
a calendar, grouping items by the date of the event they are advertising.

Please provide your design in .jpg or .png format (I do not use PhotoShop)

Additionally, the site needs:

* It must look GREAT on a mobile phone.
* The details of each event must be able to maximize/minimize
* Must be clear which day each event belongs to
* A positive/nourishing/creative theme. (This is a DANCE email list)
* An unobtrusive menu that links to a "Support" page and an "About" page.
* To have a button/link near the top of the page for "maximize all"
* To have a button/link near the bottom for "show more"
* Must use common web fonts.

Note that I am not set on the buttons being labeled with those words, but that is the function
they need to carry.

Any images that you use in your design, please provide them as separate attachments in .png format with a transparent background.

I'm looking forward to what you come up with!!

Jack

==================

I can build the site using Zurb Foundation. What I need from you is a great design that
displays the same information as the website referenced above, but that LOOKS GREAT on a
smartphone.
