There is a project in existence that still needs some design work.

Take a look at http://dancer.jackdesert.com

The site takes the contents of an email list-serve, and generates
a calendar, grouping items by the date of the event they are advertising.

I can build the site using Zurb Foundation. What I need from you is a great design that
displays the same information as the website referenced above, but that LOOKS GREAT on a
smartphone.

Please provide your design in .jpg or .png format (I do not use PhotoShop)

Additionally, the site needs:

* It must look GREAT on a mobile phone.
* The details of each event must be able to maximize/minimize
* Must be clear which day each event belongs to
* A positive/nourishing/creative theme. (This is a DANCE email list)
* A menu that links to a "Support" page and an "About" page.
* To have a button/link near the top of the page for "maximize all"
* To have a button/link near the bottom for "show more"
* A subtitle under the title
* Must use common web fonts.

Note that I am not set on the buttons being labeled with those words, but that is the function
they need to carry.

Please provide images used in the site as separate attachments in .png format with a transparent background.

I'm looking forward to what you come up with!!

Jack
