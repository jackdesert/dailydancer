Oh Geez, where was that email? I'm sure it's around here somewhere. It's a dance, right? At conduit...or was it at SomaSpace? In the evening, probably? Let me sift through my email searching for anything from this list and something that says "dance" on it. Well, that might be a little too generic. How about "dance + Philip" since he's hosting. Hmmmm, still can't find it.

Wait, there's a new thing out: http://dailydancer.jackdesert.com that keeps track of this sort of thing for me. Anything that comes from this list ends up there, correlated by event date. Oh got it! It's in Philip's basement!!! Whew!

(Maybe do this with a real event that's coming up ??)

===============  v6   ==========================
