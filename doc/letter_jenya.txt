Hi,

First of all, thanks for keeping the sacred circle list going. It's a great way for me to find out what's going on in the community.

Second, I want to show you a site I've built that shows a day-by-day view of what events have been posted, grouped by event date.

http://dailydancer.jackdesert.com

It's not searchable by Google.

I'll send a message to the list announcing it after I've done some more user testing.
