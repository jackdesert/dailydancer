Hi Jack,

Thanks again for ordering my gig.

If you want a stunning user experience, here is my feedback for you -

1. be visual! It is great that you are providing this service but why black and grey!!! This is so dismal looking.
2. You should find a great image that relates to the Sacred Circle visitor, that speaks to them, and make it your background image. Put a bold welcome message at the left in contrast, and then move your events feed to the right (it should take up about 1/3 of the page).

3. Great that you have included the FAQs section, but be careful what you write (even if you set that crawlers shouldn't crawl the pages, it doesn't guarantee it will stay out of google results)

4. Also, include a link to Sacred Circle!! Make it easy for your visitors to cross check things and think about what information would be useful for them

5. I'd also consider trying to format the content in your event posts. if possible, for example (maybe not because of the format of the data you are receiving but it is worth a shot) I'd extract the address and post it in separate elements/columns (or at least highlight it in a unique colour)

Cheers,
Sarah
