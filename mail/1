*Love Tribe Women=E2=80=99s Snuggle and Romp*
A Heart Centered Night for Women of All Ages and Orientations

May 16, 7:30-Midnight
(Doors open at 7:30, close at 8)

SW Portland, downtown. Location given to those who RSVP.
$15 paid at the door

A sweet, sensual Party as only Love Tribe can do !
Snuggling (and more if you choose), dancing, snacking, games, boundary
exercises, sweet connection within a beautiful Sacred Space. Love Tribe=E2=
=80=99s
core values are Connected, Caring, Consensual, Communicative and Community.

This will be a Snuggle until 10:00 when it becomes an optional Romp.
In a Snuggle, we run no sexual energy.  After 10 is an opportunity to get
juicier (no actual sex). Specifics will be explained.

*Volunteering*: It takes a team of volunteers to produce high quality
events and as part of our Community value, we invite you to volunteer. (You
can receive a discount if you need it).  Being part of a team is the best
way to meet others and is totally fun!  There is a limited number of
volunteer opportunities for this event.

Please bring: $15, a healthy snack luck item (finger food) and/or drink.
All our parties are clean and sober so that everyone can be fully present
to themselves and each other.

You are encouraged to dress sensually, soft, touchable fabrics, whatever
helps you feel comfortable to express your radiant self. Layers are always
good.

RSVP at safeandsacred@gmail.com
In your RSVP, Please put Snuggle in the title and be sure to tell us how
many you are registering for and if you are willing to volunteer.
