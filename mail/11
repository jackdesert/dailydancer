Dancers,

So far in the Being the Change series, we=E2=80=99ve talked about our cultu=
ral
context, the impact of sexual assault, and practiced tools for engaging
better consent and care in our relationships.

Now comes an opportunity for an extended dialogue with an expert in the
field, who works directly with people who show abusive tendencies to help
them heal. Come with your burning questions, fill in the gaps of your
understanding, and leave feeling inspired and better equipped to make deep
changes in the world.

We=E2=80=99ll learn about what abusive patterns of behavior look like in th=
e real
world, and how it=E2=80=99s different than many of the common narratives of=
 abuse
that we are taught to believe.

With the help and experience of a knowledgeable expert in the field, we=E2=
=80=99ll
begin to understand some behavioral patterns and personality qualities that
are more common among people prone to being abusive.

We will make connections through personal reflection about how these
personality qualities, behavioral patterns, and belief systems show up in
our communities.

We=E2=80=99ll also learn about some important resources to help people with=
 abusive
patterns of behavior change and heal.

$10 suggested donation, no one turned away for lack of funds. Donations go
to offset expenses and excess donations go directly to the organizations
supporting this work and participating in these events. Your support is
greatly appreciated.
