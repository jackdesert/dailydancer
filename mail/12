Our Open Reservoirs have provided safe and healthy drinking water for over
100 years. Open reservoirs naturally protect us from toxic and carcinogenic
gases and chemicals, such as radon, which is particularly prevalent in the
Pacific Northwest.

Please support keeping our open reservoirs intact by attending this
meeting;

Portland City Council will review demolition of Washington Park reservoirs
- FAST TRACK.

Thursday, April 23 @ 2 PM
Council Chambers, Portland City Hall.

Thank you for caring!

Sabby Lou

PS. EPA will be soon reviewing the LT2 Ruling that City Council is using to
FAST TRACK this decommissioning project so that corporations such as
CH2MHill and others can follow through with their promised contracts. There
is NO REASON the city shouldn't ask for a deferral, or waiver such as the
one gotten by New York state for their open-air reservoirs. They claim they
have, and were denied. They have not tried hard enough. They'd rather just
raise our rates!
