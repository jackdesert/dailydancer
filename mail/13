After getting to hear and meet Tara Brooks on her recent visit to Portland
to play at the Believe You Me night, I was impressed by the musical
textures she lays down, the authentic person behind the sounds and her
commitment and passion for music to be a vehicle for healing.

This inspired the manifestation of another opportunity to have her back in
a larger venue hosting her on another Funktion One sound system, with LOTS
of room for dancing!!!

So here we go=E2=80=A6

All Ages welcome - Alcohol Free
@ Refuge - 116 SE Yamhill

Doors at 9:30pm
Music begin at 10:00pm

Admission: $10

~Tara Brooks
Desert Hearts / Subtract Music

There is a line where the dark fuses with the light, the surreal with the
sublime, the graceful with the powerful; it is within this line that Tara
Brooks has carved out her truly distinct sound. Whether playing at an
intimate club, a packed festival or a magical sunrise deep in the Burning
Man Playa, Tara's music envelopes the crowd, stirring them with deep
grooves, hypnotic rhythms and haunting melodies. Behind the decks, her
passion and love for music is contagious-- Savoring every moment her smile
beams out to a sea of faces who are right there with her, dancing away and
smiling right back.

~Manoj
Inspire Truth / Howl / White Out / Curve / Uplift

DJ Manoj arose from the dancefloor and will always be a dancer at heart. He
is one of the pioneers in the west coast dance culture emerging circa 1991
both shaping and being shaped by this amazing adventure. Continually moved
and changed by the power of music and the many transformational experiences
he encounters while dancing and performing, he now dedicates his life to
share with others the inspirations that he has received. Understanding and
deeply rooted in the legacy of the the most formidable founding dj's, that
the power of dance music is unleashed through the ability to take dancers
on a journey, he uses the contemporary technologies available with the vast
genres of music to weave a limitless musical landscape.

Realizing every opportunity to play music for others is a gift, he does his
best to stay open, meet people where they are at and then take them to a
more inspiring, lighter and playful space within themselves as the music
comes through.
