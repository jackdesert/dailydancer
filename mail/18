Hello Dancing Friends, 

I'm still high from our amazing toning/ sound bath circle last Thursday. Will keep the bliss train going with our High Vibration Studio Practice a week from tonight. Read on if you're free... Would love to play with you in the High Vibration Studio! ~Mikaela

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Come springboard your life into greater joy by embodying the Vibrations/Qualities of your Higher Self.

The High Vibration Studio™ Practice is part energy maintenance, part manifestation workshop (from your Higher Self as opposed to your Egoic self) & part spa treatment... for your body, mind, and Soul.

Activities in the High Vibration Practice include but are not limited to: gentle movement, vibrational sound healing & toning, visioning & declaration, virtual reality, laughter, breath work and play... as well as a guided hypnotic induction that will help anchor in all the powerful, high-vibration qualities of your Higher Self.

With the High Vibration Studio™, I’ve taken my 20 years research & experience of both Eastern and Western practices and what I’ve received directly from my Higher Self, and created a fun, one-of-a-kind, step-by-step process that will help you release stress and raise your vibration allowing you to open and better embody the Vibrations of your Higher Self. When you are embodying the qualities of your H.S., your life is filled with more Grace and Synchronicity.

You walk your days knowing you are on path... Confident, free and full of joy.

I guarantee you will leave the Studio in a significantly higher vibration than when you arrived. You’ll feel calm, joyful and excited about the possibilities in your life. If you don't, I'll give you your money back. :-)


Where: The beautiful studio at Awakenings Wellness Center. 1012 SE 12th Ave. Please enter via the ramp to the north of the house, next to the mural on the adjacent building wall.


When: The 4th Tuesday of the month. (4/28) The doors open at 7:15. Please arrive around 7:15 to be ready to begin promptly at 7:30.


Love exchange: $10-15 sliding scale. Cash only please.


Please wear comfortable clothing, and bring a notebook or pen & paper and water. **Also, bring a sock or scarf to put over your eyes for the hypnosis part if ya like. The lights do dim, but not completely. 


I look forward to seeing you and getting into a High Vibration together so that we can more fully live our lives as we intended for ourselves before we came into the body!
