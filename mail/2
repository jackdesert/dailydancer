*Tools for Transition and Transformation: SoulCollage=C2=AE*

Many of us feel ourselves changing, perhaps slowly, or perhaps too rapidly
to keep up. SoulCollage=C2=AE can really assist your process, giving voice =
to
all of your parts, helping you to uncover your own extraordinary well of
wisdom. Listening to the parts that embrace movement, those that hinder
you, what you yearn for, what you envision, where you are now.

Each card in the deck you build (any number) represents a distinct energy,
emerging through your intuition. What fun it is to allow your soul to speak
in its native language, and one we can understand; imagery. Then continue
working and playing at your own pace at home and in Card Making Nights with
others. Materials are provided.  Absolutely no art or other experience is
needed.

*Risk to discover that all the answers truly are within you !*

Sunday, May 3, 1:45 to 6:00.  $40 to $55 sliding scale.  Space is limited,
registration required.

Close in East side, location given to those who register at joautumnb@gmail=
.com


I am a trained SoulCollage=C2=AE Facilitator and a life-long Transformation=
al
Artist, Dancer, Writer, Shamanic Energy Healer and Spiritual Coach.  I am
dedicated to using the intuitive arts to assist others on their personal
path to embody their Highest Selves.
