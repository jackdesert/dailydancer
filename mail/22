Calling all Wild Women - Come and Join us on the Oregon Coast in a
beautiful beach house beginning May 1st at 4 pm until May 4th at noon.
Delight in amazing organic food, Beltane Celebration Ritual, hot tubbing,
and many juicy surprises!

Come now sisters, be witnessed each one. Adoration is our medicine. We are
worthy of this! In truth, it is our responsibility to allow ourselves to be
nourished! Come and lets adorn ourselves and each other in preparation for
the sacred time of sowing seeds. Let's build a trust in this circle that
the seeds we sow are of the sweetest dreams imaginable. What heart-dreams
are you calling to flower, fruit, & harvest?

Together we will build altars, share in deep conversations, engage in daily
ritual, take time to rest and enjoy nature, soak in the hot tub, thoroughly
adore one another with luxurious beauty blends made with love, sharing the
pleasures of ecstatic living! Let's dance, laugh, run, play, and be WILD
together...

**For this ritual it is very potent to consummate our personal prayers with
the earth, inseminating her with our intentions. There are no expectations
attached to how this happens. You are welcome to do this on your own, with
another person, in a group (always with consent). You are welcome engage in
any way that is natural to you. They key is to do it with gusto and deepest
respect for this ancient and sacred rite ;-) **

Hosted by Kriyanna Feyalove & Tricia Radford

Come for three full days starting the evening of May 1st through the
afternoon of May 4th.

*Love Offering* Sliding Scale $222 ~ $444

Creative payment options available. Seeking a couple people to help in the

Diving deep into our shared blessings
May we remember the secrets that we keep
Sharing our wisdom and setting ourselves free"
