We get blocked, we get stuck, we get frustrated, and end repeating the same
habits and patterns over and over again. Let=E2=80=99s break the cycle! Per=
sonally
I'm sick of being stuck and feeling like I don't have control over my
actions. What=E2=80=99s the best thing to do when you are stuck? First STOP=
 what
you are doing, then DROP it and DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT! Simple, but easier
said than done.
I want to offer this opportunity to shake things up in the middle of your
work week, to offer something different to create change and open the
doorway to new possibilities. I love new possibilities! The easiest way I
have found to create change and allow a new expression of life is
throughconnection
to subconscious mind. What an endlessly amazing and fascinating place!
There are many ways to access the wisdom of the subconscious, the modality
I will be using during this lunch time offering with be through shamanic
drumming and intention setting. The drum really helps in knocking things
loose and breaking down stuck energy. The beat of the drum also gets us
into trance quickly and easily where we can more easily have visions and
realizations about our intentions and how to easily have what we desire.
Another aspect of the shamanic journeying that has been endlessly valuable
to me has been my spirit animal guides. Our animal guides are our allies,
each animal brings their own gifts and wisdom, I cannot express enough how
valuable my guides have been to me. Of all the healing modalities I have
experienced (and I love learning about all kinds of things) the connection
to my animal guides has been the most powerful and healing. Meeting and
gaining guidance and wisdom from our animal guides will be part of this
process.
Come play! Create new possibilities! Embrace your desires!
