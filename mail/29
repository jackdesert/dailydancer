The Raven Speaks Lightning Lodge will be hosting an information gathering on Tuesday, April 21st from 7 pm to 9 pm about our Summer Vision Quest and Eagle Dance ceremonies being offered in the Pacific NW. 
If you have always wanted to do your own Vision Quest under the guidance of a deep and spiritual Shamanic tradition, we can provide an alchemical container in which to do so. Our Eagle Dance is a 1 day SunDance that supports anyone in dancing and praying to the sacred tree of life. Our ceremonies are all done in nature on private land so that we can truly learn from the Great teachers of life in a safe and nurturing way. 
The dates of the Dance: August 1st, 2nd and 3rd. Inclusive
Vision Quest dates: August 4th thru the 8th.
You can attend one or both depending on your availability.
Please join us to learn more about what is required to participate in ceremony. If you are unable to attend the Information Night, please let us know of your interest and we will find a way to provide you with the necessary information.
Contact us at: 503-747-7330 to RSVP or email: lightningravens@comcast.net and we will provide you with our location.
