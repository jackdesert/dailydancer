*Consent Puja: A Deeply Connective Evening*

This Saturday, explore and practice consent skills in a variety of fun ways
within a sacred setting, understand boundaries better. This is filling up
nicely with people from a variety of groups, and there is still some space
left.

Saturday April 25, 7:00-10:00, Cost $20

When we are present to our feelings, the sensations in our bodies and we
are caring for the person in front of us, consent and checking in come
naturally.  We will drop deeply into ourselves and connect with each other
from a heart centered place. You will briefly partner with others and
engage in a variety of non-sexual touch, with consent of course ! *Whether
you are brand new to the touch positive/consent culture, want to improve
your communication skills or just desiring a deeply heart connected evening
out, you are welcome.*

What is a Puja? A ritual in which one practices reverence for the divine,   in
this case, we will be honoring the divine within each of us.

What is appropriate dress? Comfortable clothes, layers to remove, nice
fabrics to touch (sensual), divine wear encouraged.

What should I bring ? Please bring $20, a snack to share and a pillow to
sit on.  If you can bring more than one pillow, that would be greatly
appreciated.

To register, contact joautumnb@gmail.com Location will be given only to
those who register.

JoAutumn Brock has been a facilitator and active member in the touch/sex
positive culture for over 10 years. Her passion is creating sacred space
for authentic self expression within community.
