Subject: Earth Day Movie showing
To:


I would like to invite you to a very special movie showing on Earth Day,
Wednesday April 22.

April Blair, Mother Earth School co-founder, and I are featured in the
film, *Dancing with Thoreau*. It's about the need and value of nature
connection, and my part in it specifically talks about garden-based
learning and the responsibility we have as creative thinkers to employ
effective solutions to the global challenges we're facing.

We're asking for a $10-20 donation at the door and proceeds benefit Mother
Earth School, which, as you know, directly addresses the epidemic of
"nature deficit disorder" as author Richard Louv describes it. To connect
deeply with nature is to know how you are a part of it. What one does from
there in life is informed by this embodied knowing that everything we do to
nature we're also doing to ourselves.

Please take a look at (and share!) the event information below.

Thanks!

Matt

* * *

Nature and our modern world. What's the next step?

Dancing with Thoreau is Chris Korrow's new feature film about our
connection with nature, and specifically the benefits of a connection with
nature. The film explores how and why we, as a Western society, can and
should reconnect with our environment.

Climate scientists tell us we might be heading toward irreversible climate
change, and so many of us do our best to =E2=80=9Cgo green.=E2=80=9D The fi=
lm defines a
different kind of environmental activism, chronicling our need for nature
connection and its innumerable benefits, including perception, awareness,
and the importance of children spending time in nature.

Portland's own Matt Bibeau and April Blair of Mother Earth School
<http://www.motherearthschool.org> are featured in this film, along with
some very notable cast, including Jon Young, Richard Louv, David Suzuki,
His Holiness the Dalai Lama and more!

Dancing with Thoreau is showing on Earth Day, Wednesday April 22, at
Taborspace, 5441 SE Belmont Street. Doors open at 6pm. Movie begins at
6:30. Matt, April, and the film director, Chris Korrow, will be there to
talk about the film's message and answer questions from the audience. Cost
of attendance is $10-20 sliding scale at the door and the proceeds benefit
Mother Earth School's efforts to provide access to nature-based education.
