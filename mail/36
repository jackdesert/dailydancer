Compassionate Communication Plus: Living from the Heart
A weekend workshop led by Phyllis Brzozowska
May 15-17, 2015

=93Compassionate Communication helps me bring my inner world into the relat=
ional world. I want to connect to life as it flows through me so that I can=
 connect to life as it flows through you. It is the same life.=94 -- Robert=
 Gonzales, PhD

I came to the work of Robert Gonzales by way of the study of Nonviolent Com=
munication (NVC), as do most people. Encountering NVC was life changing for=
 me. It provided me with exquisite tools for growing in self-awareness, sel=
f-connection and empathy. Robert Gonzales=92 work builds on these tools and=
 invites you to go way beyond NVC as simply a language model. It invites yo=
u to connect to your fullest and deepest authentic self, the self that is c=
ompassion, that is love and that is whole.

This work is about living your Passion. And when life events or circumstanc=
es appear to block you from living the fullness of your Passion, it is thro=
ugh Compassion, within yourself, with others or situations that we find hea=
ling and are empowered to transform our experience.

In this weekend workshop, we will start with an overview of the basics of C=
ompassionate Communication. You=92ll be introduced to the =93Beauty of Need=
s=94 =96 how our life force energy manifests in us as the yearnings of our =
hearts. Then we=92ll dive into and learn two of the core practices develope=
d by Robert Gonzales as roadmaps for cultivating inner clarity, loving conn=
ections and mutual understanding.

About Me=85.

I began studying with Robert Gonzales in 2006 and was in the first class of=
 his two-year, intensive study called the LIFE Program. (LIFE being an acro=
nym for Living and Integrating, Full Embodiment.) I have worked as Robert=
=92s Assistant since 2007, managing the day-to-day administration of the LI=
FE Program and coordinating his national and international trainings.=20

I moved to Portland, Oregon in 2010 when Robert moved his center here from =
Prescott, Arizona and renamed it the Center for Living Compassion. I have t=
aught classes in Compassionate Communication for the Prescott Center for No=
nviolent Communication and Unity of Portland.  I=92ve led small workshops a=
nd also worked one-on-one coaching individuals and couples in Compassionate=
 Communication.

--------------------------------------

Sliding Scale Fees=20

I would like you to consider paying a bit more than you are used to paying =
if you are in an upper-income bracket, and a bit less than you are used to =
paying if you are in a lower income bracket. In this society, we tend to fo=
rget that lower income people have much less disposable income for extras o=
f any kind than do higher income people. So what ends up happening is that =
lower income people actually end up subsidizing the participation of higher=
 income people at events where everyone pays the same price to attend.

If you have lots of dependents, please consider paying a bit less than the =
amounts listed below. If you have few or no dependents, please consider pay=
ing a bit more than the amounts listed below.

If you are at all uncomfortable with my suggested fee scale, please pay wha=
tever amount you feel is right for you to pay. YOU are the best judge of wh=
at you can afford to pay.

If you make less than $15,000 per year, please consider paying $50 or more.
If you make $15,000 to 25,000 per year, please consider paying $80 or more.
If you make $25,000 to $50,000 per year, please consider paying $120 or mor=
e.
If you make $50,000 to $100,000 per year, please consider paying $160 or mo=
re.
If you make $100,000 or more per year, please consider paying $200 or more.
