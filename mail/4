*Consent Puja: Explore and Perhaps Expand Your Boundaries*


*A Deeply Connective Evening*

*This *Saturday April 25, 7:00-10:00, Cost $20

Why do we want to touch ?  Besides the obvious health benefits, certainly
we want to connect with others.  Sometimes we don=E2=80=99t know how deeply=
 we want
to go, until we are offered the opportunity to take the next step.  The
next step might be gently pushing the edge of a boundary you are well aware
of.  Sometimes, we don=E2=80=99t know where a boundary is until we try to
incrementally expand it. Then we have the choice to say yes or no.

At this sweet event you will briefly partner with others and engage in a
variety of non-sexual touch.  Dropping deeply into yourself and connecting
from a heart centered place, you will get to practice all the varieties of
consent so that you can feel safe in any situation. *Whether you are brand
new to the touch positive/consent culture, want to improve your
communication skills or just desiring a deeply heart connected evening out,
you are welcome.*

What is a Puja? A ritual in which one practices reverence for the divine,  =
 in
this case, we will be honoring the divine within each of us.

What is appropriate dress? Comfortable clothes, layers to remove, nice
fabrics to touch (sensual), divine wear encouraged.

What should I bring ? Please bring $20, a snack to share and a pillow to
sit on.  If you can bring more than one pillow, that would be greatly
appreciated.

To register, contact safeandsacred@gmail.com  Location will be given only
to those who register.

JoAutumn Brock has been a facilitator and active member in the touch/sex
positive culture for over 10 years. Her passion is creating sacred space
for authentic self expression within community.
