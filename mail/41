*Tools for Transition and Transformation: SoulCollage=C2=AE*

   Many of us feel ourselves changing, perhaps slowly, or perhaps too
rapidly to keep up. SoulCollage=C2=AE can really assist your process, giving
voice to all of your parts, helping you to uncover your own extraordinary
well of wisdom. Listening to the parts that embrace movement, those that
hinder you, what you yearn for, what you envision, where you are now.

   Each card in the deck you build represents a distinct energy, emerging
through your intuition. What fun it is to allow your soul to speak in its
native language, and one we can all understand; imagery. Then continue
working and playing at your own pace. Materials are provided.  Absolutely
no art or other experience is needed.

 Risk to discover that all the answers truly are within you !

* Sunday, May 3, 1:45 to 6:00*.  $40 to $55 sliding scale. Space is
limited, registration required. Close in East side, location given to those
who register.

 I am a trained SoulCollage=C2=AE Facilitator and a life-long Transformatio=
nal
Artist, Dancer, Writer, Shamanic Energy Healer and Spiritual Coach.  I am
dedicated to using the intuitive arts to assist others on their personal
path to embody their Highest Selves.
