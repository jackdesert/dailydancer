  .question How does it work?
  .answer Daily Dancer is a computer program that reads the Sacred Circle email list and determines which messages are event announcements. Anything that represents an event gets displayed, grouped next to other events happening the same day.

  .question I posted something to the list, and it does not show up on Daily Dancer. What do I do?
  .answer First, does your message represent an event? Only events show up on Daily Dancer.
  .answer Second, has the message already come through the list?
  .answer
    Third, if the above are true and it still does not show up,
    %a{href: 'mailto:Jack%20Desert<jworky@gmail.com>?subject=Daily%20Dancer%20Support'} send us an email
    so we can help. Please reference the subject line of the message you posted to the list and what day and time you sent it.

  .question I have a suggestion. Where do I send it?

    %a{href: 'mailto:Jack%20Desert<jworky@gmail.com>?subject=Daily%20Dancer%20Feedback'} send feedback by email

  .answer Daily Dancer uses open-source technologies---a combination of ruby, regular expressions, sinatra, sqlite, the sequel gem, jqlite, JavaScript, and CSS.
